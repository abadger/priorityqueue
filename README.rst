# priorityqueue
Tests and timings of Python3 Priority Queue implementations

The internet seems to say that the easiest way to implement a Priority Queue in
Python is with the queue.PriorityQueue class and the fastest code is made using
the heapq module.  I wrote a few sample implementations to test just how true
this is.
